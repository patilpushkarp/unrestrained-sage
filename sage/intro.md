# Namaste !

> You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to inaction. - Bhagvad Gita

I have been hearing this shloka from time to time since my childhood but it is more difficult to follow than said. Still this shloka will remain the driving factor for me to learn whatever is necessary. I aspire to lead my learning journey keeping this as the foremost principle. In order to be wiser, a man should never stop learning.  
This site is just to keep a record of whatever I learn and correct myself with the help of the awesome open source community around the world. I will consider it my immense pleasure if it ever helps you gain anything in your life.
