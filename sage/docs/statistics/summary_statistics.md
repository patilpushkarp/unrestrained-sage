# Summary Statistics

## Central Tendencies
A central tendency is the central or typical value for a probability distribution. It attempts to describe the set of data by identifying the central position of the set of the data. Measures of central tendency are also known as the measures of central location. 

### Arithmetic Mean
The arithmetic mean is equal to the sum of all the values in the set of data divided by the total number of values in the set of data. It is the value that produces the least error from all the other values in the dataset. It is susceptible to the presence of outliers in the dataset. It can only be represented by a single value i.e. a dataset cannot have more than one mean. The population mean is represented by  and the sample mean is represented by x. 

### Mode
The most frequently occurring value in the dataset is the mode of the dataset. In order words, it is the most popular value in the dataset. Normally, it is used for the categorical data. To find the mode of continuous variables, either bucket the values into some specific ranges and select the bucket with the highest frequency or select the highest value (peak value) of the probability distribution curve. This is not a unique value in the dataset. Two or more categories can have the same frequencies and hence a dataset can have two or more values of mode. Data with more than one mode is known as a multimodal dataset.

### Median
Median is the value at the centre when a dataset is arranged according to order of magnitude. This value is unaffected by the presence of outliers. For an odd number of values in the data, the median is the middle mark or the value at the middle but for an even number of values in the data, the median is the mean of the two middle values of the data.

## Spread
Variance and standard deviation are the measures of the spread of data around the central tendency. In datasets with small spread, values lie closer to the central tendency while in datasets with large spread, values lie away from the central tendency. Large spread signifies that the central tendency used is not as representative of the data. Spread can only be calculated for continuous variables.

### Variance
Variance is the sum of the square of the deviations (difference between the value and the mean of the dataset) divided by the total number of values. Since the calculation involves mean, it is affected by the presence of the outliers in the dataset. Since it is a squared value, it can’t relate to the data directly. The variance of population is represented by 2 while the variance of sample is represented by S2. 

### Standard deviation
Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The standard deviation of population is represented by  while the standard deviation of sample is represented by S.

## Effect size
An effect size is the summary statistic intended to describe the size of the effect. For example, the difference between the means or comparing the difference of the group with the variability with the groups (Cohen’s d). Cohen’s d is an effect size used to indicate the standardized difference between two means.
